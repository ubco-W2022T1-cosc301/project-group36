## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Using the Google Play Store Apps dataset, we would like to explore the various app attributes in relation to each other. This could include using the install, ratings, app size, price, and genre data to see if they correlate with each other. We hope to find out interesting patterns and interrelationships between these categories and are confident in our ability to present this data and our findings in the form of a dashboard. Since all of us interact with and use these applications in our everyday lives, some of the questions we would like to explore are the top categories of apps downloaded along with the top downloaded apps from each of those categories, percentage of apps in different genres, relationship between content rating and downloads, etc.

The dataset we will be using for our group analysis project is called ‘Google Play Store Apps’, which is available for public use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. This data is sourced from Kaggle and the author for the dataset is an individual contributor named Lavanya Gupta. The data is a collection of application data for 10,000+ apps on the Google Play Store with 13 total attributes. These attributes include App names, categories, ratings, installs and price points. The inspiration for the creation of this dataset was to provide actionable insights for android developers to work on and capture the android market to succeed in developing an android app. The data was collected in Aug 2018 and the author used a Python script to scrape this data. All information in this dataset was scraped from the Google Play Store.
